    "## Hubble’s law and the distance-redshift relation\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1929 Edwin Hubble observed a sample of nearby galaxies and studied two quantities for each.The first was the galaxy’s redshift.Light from an object that is emitted at one wavelength and observed at a higher (lower) wavelength is said to be redshifted (blueshifted). Astronomers quantify this using a dimensionless parameter z, called the\n",
    "redshift and given by $$ z= {{{\\lambda}_{obs}-{\\lambda}_{emit}} \\over {\\lambda}_{emit}}$$\n",
    "where ${\\lambda}_{emit}$ is the wavelength of the light measured in the reference frame of the object when the light is emitted and ${\\lambda}_{obs}$ is the wavelength measured in the reference frame of an observer at some later time.When\n",
    "z >0, the observed light is redshifted relative to the emitted light;when z <0, the observed light is blueshifted relative to the emitted light. The light from an object such as a galaxy contains a mixture of different wavelengths at\n",
    "different intensities, called the spectrum of the object, and redshifting (or blueshifting) causes the entire spectrum to be displaced by a common factor. Because certain features in a galaxy’s spectrum, such as emission or absorption lines, have known wavelengths and identifiable patterns, the redshift z can be determined very accurately from observations. \n",
    "The second quantity Hubble studied for each galaxy was its distance from us. This he measured himself. Determining accurate distances to faint and far away objects is a challenging, fundamental problem of observational astronomy. The ladder of measurement methods that astronomers have devised can produce reasonably accurate distance estimates in overlapping ranges from nearby stars out to very distant galaxies. Many of these methods rely on having a standard candle, a class of celestial objects whose intrinsic brightness is known. If we know how bright an object really is (called its absolute magnitude) and how bright it appears to us (called its apparent magnitude),we can determine its distance from us because the intensity of a light source decays as the inverse square of distance.\n",
    "Hubble combined the two measurements—redshift and distance—to produce a plot which shows a strong linear relationship:\n",
    "$$ z={{H_0} \\over c}d$$\n",
    "where c is the speed of light and $H_0$ is a fundamental parameter called the Hubble constant.Hubble thus found that galaxies in all directions have redshifts that tend to increase in proportion to their distances, and by interpreting redshifts as Doppler shifts, that galaxies are moving away from us at a velocity v proportional to distance:\n",
    "$$v={H_0}d$$\n",
    "This relationship is now known as Hubble’s law.Hubble onclude that every galaxy was moving away from every other and, thus, that the universe itself is expanding.\n",
    "If the universe is expanding, then extrapolating backward in time, the universe was smaller in the past, and thus more dense (with the same total mass-energy packed into a smaller volume), and thus hotter.\n",
    "Taken back far enough, this would predict a point of infinite density and temperature—a singularity known as the “Big Bang.”\n",
    "Extrapolating forward in time, cosmologists could then predict three possible fates for the universe, depending on whether the gravitational pull of all the universe’s mass-energy is sufficient to overcome the energy of the Big Bang that is driving the universe’s expansion. In an open universe, the total mass-energy is insufficient, and the universe will expand forever. In a closed universe, the total mass-energy is sufficient to halt the expansion, and the universe will collapse in on itself in a “Big Crunch.” On the boundary between these two cases is a flat universe, where gravity and the expansion exactly balance.\n",
    "Theoretical cosmologists had anticipated an expanding universe several years before Hubble analyzed his data. Alexander Friedmann and George Lemaˆıtre independently used Einstein’s General Relativity to derive theoretical models that describe the dynamics and geometry of an expanding universe. These evolved into the standard model of relativistic cosmology,called the Friedmann–Robert–Walker model.\n",
    "Friedmann introduced a dimensionless function called the scale factor $\\alpha(t)$ that gives the ratio of the size of any region at time t to the size of that region at the current time $t_0$ (from which it follows that $\\alpha(t_0)=1$)\n",
    "(Cosmologists often use 0 subscripts for quantities at the current age of the universe.)\n",
    " The function $\\alpha(t)$ describes the universe’s entire expansion history. Friedmann derived the following equation that describes how the scale factor evolves: $${({\\dot{\\alpha(t)} \\over {\\alpha(t)}})}^2={{8\\pi G} \\over 3}{\\rho(t)}={{kc^2} \\over{\\alpha^2(t)}}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\dot\\alpha(t)$ the time derivative of $\\alpha(t)$, G is Newton’s gravitational constant, $\\rho(t)$ is the total energy density at time t, and k is a parameter describing the curvature of spacetime, which takes values −1, 0, or 1 depending on whether the universe is open, flat, or closed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Friedmann equation connects the universe’s geometry (e.g., size,curvature) to its content (e.g., energy density). An observer at time t who replicated Hubble’s study would find a linear relationship between recession velocity and distance to nearby galaxies with slope $$H(t) = { {\\dot{\\alpha} (t)} \\over {\\alpha} (t)} $$ \n",
    "This Hubble parameter H(t) describes the (local) relative expansion rate and is constant for all observers at a particular time; at thecurrent time,we get the Hubble constant $H_0=H(t_0)$. In a flat universe—when k= 0 in Friedmann's equation —the total energy density is determined by H and is called the critical density ${\\rho}_{crit}$:\n",
    "$${\\rho}_{crit}={{3H^2} \\over {8\\pi G}}$$\n",
    "If $\\rho > {\\rho}_{crit}$ the universe is closed; If $\\rho < {\\rho}_{crit}$ the universe is open;if $\\rho={\\rho}_{crit}$ \n",
    "the universe is flat. Cosmologists refer to these cases in terms of the scaled density parameter: $$ \\Omega \\equiv{\\rho \\over{\\rho}_{crit}}$$ \n",
    "giving $\\Omega >1$, $\\Omega <1$ and $\\Omega=1$ for closed, open, and flat respectively.\n",
    "Relating these theoretical expressions to Hubble’s observation, the redshift z can also be expressed in terms of $\\alpha$. As the universe expands, light waves traveling through it are stretched out by the expansion increasing the wavelength by the factor by which the universe has expanded between the emission and observation times. That is, light emitted at time $t_{emit}$ with wavelength $\\lambda_{emit}$ and observed at time $t_{obs}$ has wavelength $\\lambda_{obs}=\\lambda_{emit}(1+z)$ where the redshift z is given by: $$ z={{\\alpha(t_{obs})} \\over {\\alpha(t_{emit})}} -1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Redshift is a measure of distance as well. Hubble’s relation defines a frame of reference in which an observer at rest in that frame sees galaxy recession velocities proportional to distance in all directions. Such an observer is said to be comoving with respect to the Hubble expansion. In contrast,an observer moving relative to this reference frame would see systematically higher recession velocities behind than in front. The distance measured with a tape-measure between two comoving observers at time t has the form: $d(t)=\\alpha(t)cr$ where r is called the comoving distance between the two observers, which we express in units of time. But recession velocities are not observable, redshifts are. The comoving distance between an observer and an object at redshift z is derived by computing tape-measure distances between nearby events along the line of sight to the object and adjusting each such distance for the corresponding expansion of the universe.This gives: $$r(z)=\\int_{0}^{z}{dz' \\over H(z')}$$\n",
    "By carefully measuring objects’ redshifts and distances, it is possible to estimate the distance-redshift relation and,\n",
    "in turn, the universe’s expansion history, its eventual fate, and a variety of fundamental cosmological parameters.\n",

    "## Friedmann Cosmology\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical framework of cosmology is mainly based on the the way of defining the distance between two points in the Universe at cosmological scale. Let us consider a coordinate system where the coordinate separation between two points is $\\vec{x}$ then the real distance between these two points are $$ \\vec{r}=\\alpha(t)\\vec{x}$$\n",
    "where the $\\alpha(t)$ , called the scale factor, takes care of the time evolution of the real distance.\n",
    "As the Universe expands, the real distance increases, even between two comoving objects for whom the coordinate distance \n",
    "$(\\vec{x})$ remains the same. The idea of homogeneity ensures that the scale factor a is only a function of time.\n",
    "The most general way of defining the line element, which satisfies the cosmological principle, is the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric,which is written as: $$ ds^2=-dt^2+{\\alpha}^2(t)[{dr^2 \\over {1-kr^2}}+r^2(d{\\theta}^2+sin^2{\\theta}d{\\phi}^2)]$$\n",
    "where t is cosmic time and (r, θ , φ ) are the spatial coordinates and k is the curvature parameter which determines the nature of the spatial geometry.\n",
    "Along with the cosmological principle, two other basic assumption in the modelling of the Universe are, (i) general relativity is the correct theory of gravity, and (ii) the matter distribution of the Universe can be represented as ideal fluid. Einstein’s field equations which are the key equations of general relativity, are written as, $$ G_{\\mu\\nu}\\equiv R_{\\mu\\nu}-{1 \\over 2 }g_{\\mu\\nu}R=8\\pi GT_{\\mu\\nu}$$\n",
    "where $G_{\\mu\\nu}$ is the Einstein tensor,$R_{\\mu\\nu}$ is the Ricci tensor, R is the Ricci scalar and $T_{\\mu\\nu}$ is the energy momentum tensor. Introducing the FRW metric to the Einstein’s field equations one arrives at the two basic equations of cosmology, $$3{{\\dot{\\alpha}}^2 \\over {\\alpha}^2}+3 {k \\over {\\alpha}^2}=8\\pi G\\rho$$\n",
    "and $$2{{\\ddot{\\alpha}} \\over \\alpha}+ {{{\\dot{\\alpha}}^2 +k} \\over {\\alpha}^2}=-8\\pi Gp$$\n",
    "These are known as the Friedmann equations. Here, ρ and p are respectively the energy density and pressure of perfect fluid for which the energy momentum tensor is $T^{\\mu}_{\\nu}=Diag(-\\rho,p,p,p)$. \n",
    "The Hubble parameter, which is the fractional rate of expansion of the linear size of the Universe, is defined as, $$ H(t) = { {\\dot{\\alpha} (t)} \\over {\\alpha} (t)} $$ \n",
    "The Friedmann equations can be written in terms of Hubble parameter and its derivatives as,$$3H^2 +3 {k \\over {\\alpha}^2}=8\\pi G\\rho$$ $(\\ast)$\n",
    "$$2\\dot{H}+3H^2+{k \\over {\\alpha}^2}=-8\\pi Gp$$\n",
    "From contracted Bianchi identity $(G^{\\mu\\nu}_{;\\mu})$ the continuity equation yields, $$\\dot{\\rho}+3H(\\rho+p)=0$$\n",
    "The energy density ( ρ ) and pressure (p) are related through an equation called the equation of state, p = w ρ , where the w is called the equation of state parameter. For pressureless dust matter the equation of state parameter w = 0 and for a distribution of photons, the value of equation of state parameter is w = 1/3. For a certain component, if the equation of state parameter w is known, the dependence of the energy density ( ρ ) upon the scale factor (a(t))\n",
    "can be determined. For instance, dust matter density ${\\rho}_{matter} \\propto  {1 \\over {\\alpha}^3 (t)} $ ,radiation or photon energy density ${\\rho}_{photon} \\propto  {1 \\over {\\alpha}^4 (t)} $ \n",
    "Now let us define a quantity called the critical density as, $${\\rho}_c (t)={3H^2 (t) \\over 8\\pi G}$$\n",
    "from $(\\ast)$ $$\\Omega(t)=1 +{k \\over 3{\\alpha}^2 H^2}$$ \n",
    "where $\\Omega (t)={ \\rho (t) \\over {\\rho}_c (t)}$ If the energy density of the Universe is exactly equal to the critical\n",
    "density, then the curvature parameter k = 0, that means that spatial geometry is flat. If $\\rho (t)>{\\rho}_c (t)$\n",
    "then the value of k is positive and it can be scaled as +1. Similarly for $\\rho (t)<{\\rho}_c (t)$ the value of k is negative and it can be scaled as −1. For k = +1, the spatial geometry of the Universe is closed and for k = −1, the spatial geometry if open.\n",
    "Observations suggest that the geometry of the spatial part of the Universe is very close to be flat.It is theoretically argued that the flatness of spatial geometry of the Universe is a consequence of an early inflation. The idea is that the rapid expansion during the inflation washed out the spatial curvature.\n",

    "## Acceleration and dark energy\n",

This energy is characterized by its negative pressure. In contrast, in a universe filled with hot gas, which has positive pressure, the energy of the gas adds to its gravitational account, slowing the expansion. With a negative pressure “fluid,” the opposite occurs, causing the universe’s expansion to accelerate.Because its source and nature are unknown and because we cannot see it directly, this energy field with negative pressure has been called dark energy.\n",

    "One of the approaches is to measure volumetric rates, while the other looks at averaged rates measured in individual galaxies, typically held up against galaxy properties such as stellar mass and star formation rate, assuming a delay time distribution going as $\\tau^{-1}$ with a transition to being constant at short delay times. From this delay time distribution a model to predict type Ia supernova rate from stellar mass and star formation rate of a galaxy is derived. This model is in excellent agreement with the current observational constraints. The model is then compared to the A+B model through various measures for goodness of fit. For all measures the A+B model performs worse. It is especially in the high specific star formation rate regime that the performance of the A+B model is poor, and the fact that this disagreement exists with a model based on a ∼$\\tau^{-1}$ delay time distribution. https://dark.nbi.ku.dk/research/publications/theses/PerThesis.pdf\n",

    "Despite their prominence,the precise physics of the Ia SNe progenitor is unknown.This is often referred to as the progenitor problem. Different models for the progenitor predict different delay time distributions (DTD). The DTD parametrises the distribution of times between the formation of the progenitor and the subsequent SN explosion. In the limit where all star formation happens instantaneously, in a brief starburst, the DTD parametrisation will reflect the rate of SN explosions that follow the starburst. In practise, the star formation history is more complex, and the observed SN rate is a convolution of the DTD and the star formation rate. This complicates modelling of SN Ia rates which plays an important role in, e.g., cosmological astrophysics and chemical evolution modelling.Different avenues can be taken when modelling SN rates. One is to measure volumetric SN rates as a function of redshift and fit an assumed DTD. This approach seems to suggest a DTD of the form DTD ~$\\tau^{-1}$ perhaps with a transition to becoming constant at early times.https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.7978.pdf This may be explained by a progenitor model with two distinct progenitors. These two progenitors are often referred to as a prompt component, with short delay times, and a delayed component, with longer delays between star formation and SN explosion. Another approach is to observe SN rates for individual galaxies as a function of star formation rate of the host galaxy, averaged over all observed galaxies. This approach does not formally define or assume a DTD, and instead assumes that the SN rate depends on physical parameters such as stellar mass and star formation rate of the host galaxy. The consensus model for this approach is the A+B model. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.00793.pdf\n"

This snap shot tells us the cosmic history from the photon decoupling epoch to the present.The angular power spectrum of CMB temperature anisotropies measured by Wilkinson Microwave  Anisotropy  Probe  (WMAP) implies  that  it  is  dominated  by acoustic peaks arising from gravity-driven sound waves in the photon-baryon fluid.  And then  the  positions  of  these  acoustic  peaks  are  shifted  by  cosmic  expansion.   Thus  the positions and amplitudes of acoustic peaks contain important cosmic information.\n",
    "Baryons were strongly coupled to photons before the decoupling epoch.  After recombination ($z_r \\approx 1100$) baryons  got  free  from  Compton  drag  of  photons  and  stayed  at  a fixed radius, i.e., sound horizon.  It determines the first acoustic peak in CMB anisotropy that we can observe directly. Since the size of the sound horizon is predicted from theory, $l_s \\sim H^{-1}(z_r)$, this sound horizon serves as a standard ruler by measuring the angular scale of the first acoustic peak.

Measuring  this  distortion  of  the  CMB,  we  can  estimate masses of the clusters.  Since the SZ effect is a scattering effect, its magnitude is redshift-independent; very distant clusters are as easy to detect as nearby clusters. When combined with accurate redshifts and mass estimates for the clusters, e.g.  X-ray observation, the SZ effect plays a role of a standard ruler and can be used as a distance indicator.  This is the same method as comparing the absolute magnitude with the apparent one.  The SZ effect may also provide interesting constraints on the dark energy. The combination of CMB and SN Ia observations indicates that our Universe is spatially flat and the matter component is about one quarter of the critical density, $\\Omega_m \\approx 0.3 $ This implies the need for dark energy as a missing component $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}=1-\\Omega_m \\approx 0.7$ which\n",

    "The sound waves that propagated in the pre-recombination universe produced a pronounced peak in the two-point correlation function of the cosmological-density field.This “baryon-acoustic oscillation” (BAO) peak,is centered on a comoving distance equal to the sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$.Observed at a redshift z, the BAO peak position in the transverse (angular) direction determines the ratio $D_M(z)/ r_d$ ,where $D_M(z)=(1 + z)D_A(z)$ is the “comoving” angular-diameter distance ($D_A$ is the “traditional” angular-diameter distance). In the radial (redshift) direction, the peak position determines $D_H(z)/ r_d$, where $D_H(z)=c/H(z)$ is the Hubble distance.Since $D_M$, $D_H$ and $r_d$ all have simple dependencies on the cosmological parameters, observation of the BAO feature constrains those parameters, especially when combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. In particular, one can constrain models beyond the flat-ΛCDM model that describes CMB data, deriving constraints on cosmological curvature and the dark-energy equation of state. Furthermore, the shape of the spectrum of CMB anisotropies can be used to calculate the value of $r_d$ to percent-level precision $r_d$ ~147 Mpc and the use of this value allows one to derive $D_M(z)$ and $D_H(z)$ from BAO measurements.These absolute distances can be combined with relative distances determined with type Ia supernovae to extrapolate to z=0, yielding a “top-down” measurement of $H_0$.\n",

    " Fine-tuning problem\n",
    " If the origin of Λ is a vacuum energy, there is a serious problem of its energy scale.  The vacuum means a state of minimum energy.  For example, for a harmonic oscillating particle the potential is of the form $V(x)={1 \\over 2}(\\omega)^2(x)^2$ In this case, the vacuum state is given by the particle  sitting  motionless  in  the  minimum  of  the  potential,  i.e.,x=  0.   But  quantum mechanically we cannot obtain position and momentum of the particle at the same time because of the uncertainty principle.  Instead, we know that the lowest energy state has an energy $E_0+{1 \\over 2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n",
    " We could consider a quantum field as an infinite set of harmonic oscillators, where the minimum energy of such a field should be also infinite.  However, if we trust our theory only up to a certain cutoff, like the Planck scale $M_{pl}$ from dimensional consideration we would get the form $$\\rho_{\\Lambda}\\sim\\hbar {M_{pl}}^4$$\n",
    " Indeed, we measure the vacuum fluctuations by the Casimir effect in the laboratory.\n",
    " For the Planck scale $ M_{pl}=(8\\pi G)^{-1/2}\\sim {10}^{18} GeV$, we expect: $$ \\rho_{\\Lambda}\\sim ({10}^{18} GeV)^4 \\sim 2\\times{10}^{110} erg/{cm}^3 $$\n",
    " However, most of cosmological observations imply: $$ {\\rho_{\\Lambda}}^{obs}\\sim ({10}^{-12} GeV)^4 \\sim 2\\times{10}^{-10} erg/{cm}^3 $$\n",
    " There is 120 orders of magnitude difference between the theoretical expectation and the observational value.  This discrepancy has been called ‘the worst theoretical prediction in the history of physics!\n",
    "  Coincidence problem\n",
    "  The second cosmological constant problem is why $\\rho_{\\Lambda}$ is  not  only  small  but  also  of  the same order of magnitude as the present mass density of the Universe.  In other words, whydoes cosmic acceleration happen to begin right now and not at some point in the past or future?\n",
    "If  the  vacuum  energy  were  big  and  dominant  from  the  earlier  epoch,  there  would be  no  chance  to  form  structures  in  the  Universe,  like  galaxies,  stars,  planets  and  us,intelligent lives.  In other words, observers will only observe the states which are allowed for observers.  This consideration is the so-called anthropic principle.  According to the anthropic principle, the Universe may not be determined directly by one specific process, but there are different expanding regions at different times and space or of different terms in the wave function of the Universe. Therefore, the value of $\\rho_{\\Lambda}$ that we measure should be just suitable for the evolution of intelligent lives.\n",
    "This  anthropic  consideration  seems  to  give  us  the  explanation  for  both  of  the  two cosmological constant problems, why it is small and why acceleration starts now.

Why  does  the  Earth  lie exactly on the habitability zone, the narrow range of distance from the Sun at which the surface temperature allows the existence of liquid water?  The answer could be that, if the Earth was not there, we would not be here.\n",

    "Second, the Universe is spatially flat. This has been argued on the basis of recent CMB results which show the presence of a sharp feature in the temperature anisotropy spectrum on the very angular scale predicted for a spatially flat Universe. The way this works is straightforward. The predominant source of temperature anisotropy is through the Sachs-Wolfe effect, whereby photons climb out of deep gravitational potentials on the surface of last scattering.At recombination, the deepest and largest length-scale gravitational potential into which photons can fall is limited by the sound horizon. The consequence is a sharp peak in the anisotropy spectrum on the angular scale corresponding to the apparent size of the sound horizon at recombination. As a problem in geometric optics, the relation between the angular scale and the size of the sound horizon depends on the spatial curvature and distance to the last scattering surface.The prediction is that the peak should occur at a multipole $l\\approx220/\\sqrt{1-\\Omega_k}$ where $\\Omega_k$ is the spatial curvature expressed as a fraction of the critical energy density.The location of the observed peak strongly supports the claim of a spatially flat Universe, with $ \\mid\\Omega_k\\mid <<1 $.\n",

This stunning claim is made on the basis of the magnitude - redshift relationship traced out by type 1a supernovae.The procedure can be summarized briefly. Although type 1a SNe are not standard candles, in that their intrinsic luminosity is not known, there appears to be an empirical relationship between the shape of the supernovae light curve and the luminosity.

Decreasing w increases the angular diameter distance which can be compensated by increasing the value of h.  Since the observed CMB anisotropies are only sensitive to the integrated distance to the decoupling redshift,  they are not sensitive to a possible temporal evolution of w.  The observed angular size of the sound horizon points to a high value of h and phantom dark energy with w <−1.A low h is only preferred if dark energy is assumed to be in the form of a cosmological constant $(w_\\Lambda =−1)$ or when additional probes of the dark energy EoS are included,  such as SNe Ia and BAO observations.\n",

In other words, the energy density of the universe comprises primarily of the nonrelativistic matter and dark energy components.Therefore, the first equation in Friedmann cosmology can be rewritten as $$ H^2 = {{H_0}^2}[\\Omega_m {(1+z)}^3 + \\Omega_{DE} exp\\{ 3\\int_0^z {dz \\over {1+z}}[1 + w(z)]\\}] $$\n",

    "### Hubble constant from CMB\n",
    "\n",
    "The physics of stellar distance calibrators is very complicated, because it comes from the era in which the Universe has had time to evolve complicated astrophysics.  A large class of alternative approaches to cosmological parameters in general involve going back to an era where astrophysicsis  relatively  simple  and  linear,  the  epoch  of  recombination  at  which  the  CMB  fluctuations  can be studied.  Although tests involving the CMB do not directly determine 𝐻0, they provide joint information about 𝐻0 and other cosmological parameters which is improving at a very rapid rate.\n",
    "In the Universe’s early history, its temperature was high enough to prohibit the formation of atoms,  and  the  Universe  was  therefore  ionized.   Approximately  $4×10^5$ yr  after  the  Big  Bang,corresponding to a redshift $𝑧_{rec}∼1000$, the temperature dropped enough to allow the formation of atoms, a point known as “recombination”.  For photons, the consequence of recombination was that photons no longer scattered from ionized particles but were free to stream.  After recombination, these primordial photons reddened with the expansion of the Universe, forming the cosmic microwave background (CMB) which we observe today as a black-body radiation background at 2.73 K.\n",
    "In the early Universe, structure existed in the form of small density fluctuations (𝛿𝜌/𝜌∼0.01) in the photon-baryon fluid.  The resulting pressure gradients, together with gravitational restoring forces, drove oscillations, very similar to the acoustic oscillations commonly known as sound waves.Fluctuations prior to recombination could propagate at the relativistic (𝑐/√3) sound speed as the Universe expanded. At recombination, the structure was dominated by those oscillation frequencies which  had  completed  a  half-integral  number  of  oscillations  within  the  characteristic  size  of  the Universe at recombination,this pattern became frozen into the photon field which formed the CMB  once  the  photons  and  baryons  decoupled  and  the  sound  speed  dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting “acoustic peaks” dominate the fluctuation spectrum.Their angular scale is a function of the size of the Universe at the time of recombination, and the angular diameter distance between us and $𝑧_{rec}$.  Since the angular diameter distance is a function of cosmological parameters, measurement of the positions of the acoustic peaks provides a constraint on cosmological parameters.  Specifically, the more closed the spatial geometry of the Universe, the smaller the angular diameter distance for a given redshift,  and the larger the characteristic scale of the acoustic peaks.  The measurement of the peak position has become a strong constraint in successive observation  and corresponds to an approximately spatially flat Universe in which $Ω_m+ Ω_Λ≃1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the global geometry of the Universe is not the only property which can be deduced from the fluctuation spectrum.The peaks are also sensitive to the density of baryons, of total (baryonic+ dark) matter, and of vacuum energy (energy associated with the cosmological constant).  These densities  scale  with  the  square  of  the  Hubble  parameter  times  the  corresponding  dimensionless densities and measurement of the acoustic peaks therefore provides information on the Hubble constant, degenerate with other parameters, principally $Ω_m$ and $Ω_Λ$.  The second peak strongly constrains the baryon density, $Ω_{b}{𝐻_0}^2$, and the third peak is sensitive to the total matter density in the form $Ω_{m}{𝐻_0}^2$.\n",
    "Although the CMB observations provide significant information about cosmological parameters,the available data constrain combinations of $𝐻_0$ with other parameters,  and either assumptions or other data must be provided in order to derive the Hubble constant.  One possible assumptionis  that  the  Universe  is  exactly  flat  (i.e.,  Ω𝑘=  0)  and  the  primordial  fluctuations  have  a  powerlaw spectrum.  In this case measurements of the CMB fluctuation spectrum with the WilkinsonAnisotropy Probe(WMAP) satellite and more recently with the Planck satellite, allow $𝐻_0$ to be derived.  This is because measuring $Ω_m ℎ^2$ produces a locus in the $Ω_m : Ω_Λ$ plane which is different from the $Ω_m+ Ω_Λ= 1$ locus of the flat Universe, and although the tilt of these two lines is not very different, an accurate CMB measurement can localise the intersection enough to give $Ω_m$ and ℎ separately.If  we  do  not  assume  the  universe  to  be  exactly  flat,then  we  obtain a degeneracy with 𝐻0 in the sense that decreasing 𝐻0 increases the total density of the universe.CMB data by themselves,  without any further assumptions or extra data,  do not supply a significant constraint  on 𝐻0 compared  to  those  which  are  obtainable  by  other  methods.\n",

    "## Early Dark energy\n",
    "\n",
    "Theoretical explanations for the Hubble tension are not easy to come by.  The biggest challenge remains the very precisely determined angular scale of the acoustic  peaks  in  the  CMB  power  spectrum,  which  fix the ratio of the sound horizon at decoupling to the distance to the CMB surface of last scatter.  Possible late-time resolutions include a phantom-like dark energy (DE) component , a vacuum phase transition,or  interacting  DE.However,  these resolutions are  tightly  constrained  by  late-time  observables,  especially those from baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO).Model-independent parameterizations of the late-time expansion history are similarly constrained.An early-time resolution, which reduces the sound horizon with additional radiation energy density  is constrained by BAO and by the higher peaks in the CMB power spectrum. It is also possible to address the Hubble tension through a modification of gravity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another early-time resolution is an exotic earlydark energy (EDE) that behaves like a cosmological constant  before  some  critical  redshift $z_c$ but  whose  energy density then dilutes faster than radiation.  This addresses the  Hubble  tension  by  increasing  the  early  expansion rate while leaving the later evolution of the Universe unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Poulin at 2019  present  two  physical  models  for  EDE,  one that involves an oscillating scalar field and another with a slowly-rolling scalar field.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first model for EDE is nominally a scalar field $\\phi$ with a potential $V(\\phi) \\propto {(1-cos[\\phi/f])}^n$. At earlytimes, the field is frozen and acts as a cosmological constant, but when the Hubble parameter drops below some value, at a critical redshift $z_c = {\\alpha_c}^{-1} -1$ , the field begins to oscillate and then behaves as a fluid with an equation of state $w_n = (n-1)/(n+1)$. In practice, numerical evolution of the scalar-field equations of motion becomes extremely difficult once the oscillations become rapid compared with the expansion rate, and so their numerical work is accomplished with an effective-fluid approach that has been tailored specifically for this potential.However their conclusions do not depend on the details of the potential and would work just as well with, e.g., a simpler ${\\phi}^{2n}$ potential. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second model is a field that slowly rolls down a potential that is linear in $\\phi$ at early times and asymptotes to zero at late times. In the effective-fluid approximation,  the EDE energy density evolves as $$ \\Omega_{\\phi} = {{2\\Omega_\\phi(\\alpha_c)} \\over {{(\\alpha/\\alpha_c)}^{3(w_n +1)} +1}}$$ which has an associated equation-of-state parameter $$w_{\\phi}(z) = {{1+w_n} \\over {{1+(\\alpha/\\alpha_c)}^{3(1+w_n)}}} -1$$\n",
    "It asymptotically approaches −1 as $\\alpha \\rightarrow 0$ and $w_n$ for $\\alpha >> \\alpha_c$ showing that the energy density is constant at early times and dilutes as $\\alpha^{-3(1+w_n)}$ once the field is dynamical.The homogeneous EDE energy density dilutes like matter for n= 1, like radiation for n= 2 and faster than radiation whenever $n \\geq 3$. For $n \\rightarrow \\infty$ on reaching the minimum of the potential $w_{\\infty}=1$ (i.e.  the scalar field is fully dominated by its kinetic energy) and the energy density dilutes as $\\alpha^{-6}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One  of  the  most  interesting  aspects  of  the  EDE  resolution  of  the  Hubble  tension  is  that  the  posterior  distributions  show  that  the  field  must  become  dynamical  around  matter-radiation  equality. The role of the EDE is to decrease $r_s$ ,  while keeping the angular scales and peak heights fixed via small shifts in other cosmological parameters. \n",

    "Mortsell at 2018 : dark radiation refers to any relativistic energy component with none or negligible electromagnetic interactions.  Early dark radiation may affect CMB fluctuations at small scales by changing the damping scale.  In principle, this can be remedied by allowing for a scale dependence in the spectral tilt,n, but since the polarization spectrum is affected differently, polarization data can potentially break the degeneracy.  Early dark radiation could also  have  an  effect  on  the  growth  of  perturbations.   It  can  give  an  earlier  freeze-out,  andhence a greater abundance of helium and deuterium from BBN.\n",

    "To increase the value of h as inferred from CMB observations, we should decrease $r_s$ since for a smaller $r_s$ to subtend the same angle, we need a smaller $D_A (z_*)$ and thus a larger h.To decrease $r_s$ we can either decrease the sound speed $c_s$ or increase H(z) at z > z∗.\n",

    "Instead of parameterizing $w(\\alpha)$ Doran at 2006 parameterize $\\Omega_d (\\alpha)$ directly. This will prove advantageous for two reasons:firstly, the amount of dark energy at early times is then a natural parameter and not inferred by integrating $w(\\alpha)$ over the entire evolution.  Secondly, since the Hubble parameter is given by $${{H^2(\\alpha)} \\over {{H_0}^2}}= {{{{\\Omega_m}^0 {\\alpha}^{-3} + {\\Omega_{rel}}^0 {\\alpha}^{-4}}} \\over {{1- \\Omega_d (\\alpha)}}}$$\n",
    "a simple, analytic expression for $\\Omega_d (\\alpha)$ enables us to compute many astrophysical quantities analytically. In the above ${\\Omega_{rel}}^0$ is the fractional energy density of relativistic neutrinos and photons today, ${\\Omega_m}^0$ is the matter (dark and baryonic) fractional energy density and we assumed a flat Universe.\n",
    "The parameterization must involve only a restricted num-ber of - physically meaningful - parameters(three: ${\\Omega_d}^0$, $w_0$, ${\\Omega_d}^e$).Start by observing that neglecting radiation, the fractional energy density of a cosmological constant evolves as $$\\Omega_{\\Lambda} (\\alpha) = {{{\\Omega_d}^0} \\over {{\\Omega_d}^0 +{\\Omega_m}^0 {\\alpha}^{-3}}}$$\n",
    "\n",

    "the first generalization of this formula is to allow $w\\neq−1$,which is achieved by $$\\Omega_d (\\alpha) = {{{\\Omega_d}^0} \\over {{\\Omega_d}^0 +{\\Omega_m}^0 {\\alpha}^{3w_0}}}$$\n",
    " The evolution of $\\Omega_d$ is connected to the equation of state w by the relation $$(3w -{\\alpha_{eq} \\over {\\alpha + \\alpha_{eq}}}) \\Omega_d (1- \\Omega_d) = -d\\Omega_d/dln\\alpha$$\n",
    " where $\\alpha_{eq}$ is the scale factor at matter-radiation equality.Demanding that $w(\\alpha=1)=w_0$ , i.e. that the parameter $w_0$ should indeed have its usual meaning, one is led to conclude that an additional term is needed in the numerator and that $\\alpha=-3w_0$.This yields the final form of parameterization, namely: $$\\Omega_d (\\alpha)={{{\\Omega_d}^0 -{\\Omega_d}^e (1-\\alpha^{-3w_0})} \\over {{\\Omega_d}^0 + {\\Omega_m}^0 \\alpha^{3w_0}}} + {\\Omega_d}^e (1-\\alpha^{-3w_0})$$\n",
    " In terms of the equation of state, going from today to the past,w starts at $w_0$.It then crosses over to $w\\approx0$ during the matter dominated era.Defining the cross-over as $w=w_0 /2$ and using the above 2 equations and working to leading order in ${\\Omega_d}^e /{\\Omega_d}^0$ , one obtains the cross-over scale factor $$\\alpha_c \\approx ({{\\Omega_d}^0 \\over {(1- {\\Omega_d}^0)} {\\Omega_d}^e})^{1 \\over 3w_0}$$\n",
    " We see from this Equation  that increasing ${\\Omega_d}^e$ increases the cross-over scale factor, as expected. Likewise, a more negative $w_0$ also increases $\\alpha_c$ i.e. cross-over of w occurs more recently. Finally, in the radiation dominated era,w tends to 1/3.\n",
    " A direct parameterization of $\\Omega_d (\\alpha)$ removes one integration otherwise necessary to compute the luminosity distance, sound horizon etc..Many cosmological quantities can then be computed analytically.\n",
