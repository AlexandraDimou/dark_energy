    "SN Ia  observations  are one  significant evidence  for the  cosmic acceleration.  When a white dwarf reaches 1.4 $M_{\\odot}$, gravity becomes bigger than the Fermi degeneracy pressure and drives the star into explosion.  Since SN Ia is made in the same process,  we  assume  that  SN  Ia  always  have  the  same  luminosity  and  it  can  be  used  as a standard  candle. Measuring the apparent magnitude,  we can estimate the luminosity distance.  A supernova is as bright as a whole galaxy, thus surveying SN Ia is very powerful and a direct way to study the distant Universe. But since the detection was first published some scientists had doubt that the distant supernovae could appear fainter just due to extinction.  Absorption by intervening dust could also lead to characteristic reddening. Nowadays thanks to Hubble Space Telescope (HST) we have high quality light curves up to $z \\approx 1.8$ and big amount of other distant SN data from ground based observations.  We are thus more convinced that this was not due to extinction by dust but due to real cosmic acceleration.\n",

When the density in the center of a CO WD becomes high enough the carbon in the WD starts to burn which eventually leads to a thermonuclear explosion, obliterating  the  WD  and  possibly  imparting  a  significant  kick on  the  companion  star.  This  critical  density when carbon-burning can start is usually attained when the WD approaches a critical mass – the Chandrasekhar limit.It is also possible that the WD may reach the Chandrasekhar mass, by accreting from a helium-burning star donor  rather  than  a  hydrogen-rich  donor.Such  formation  channels  are  expected  to  be  rare,  and these  progenitors  have  shorter  evolutionary  timescales than  the  ‘canonical’  SD  scenario  due  to  the  larger zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) mass of the secondary"

    "One of the approaches is to measure volumetric rates, while the other looks at averaged rates measured in individual galaxies, typically held up against galaxy properties such as stellar mass and star formation rate, assuming a delay time distribution going as $\\tau^{-1}$ with a transition to being constant at short delay times. From this delay time distribution a model to predict type Ia supernova rate from stellar mass and star formation rate of a galaxy is derived. This model is in excellent agreement with the current observational constraints. The model is then compared to the A+B model through various measures for goodness of fit. For all measures the A+B model performs worse. It is especially in the high specific star formation rate regime that the performance of the A+B model is poor, and the fact that this disagreement exists with a model based on a ∼$\\tau^{-1}$ delay time distribution. https://dark.nbi.ku.dk/research/publications/theses/PerThesis.pdf\n",

    "Despite their prominence,the precise physics of the Ia SNe progenitor is unknown.This is often referred to as the progenitor problem. Different models for the progenitor predict different delay time distributions (DTD). The DTD parametrises the distribution of times between the formation of the progenitor and the subsequent SN explosion. In the limit where all star formation happens instantaneously, in a brief starburst, the DTD parametrisation will reflect the rate of SN explosions that follow the starburst. In practise, the star formation history is more complex, and the observed SN rate is a convolution of the DTD and the star formation rate. This complicates modelling of SN Ia rates which plays an important role in, e.g., cosmological astrophysics and chemical evolution modelling.Different avenues can be taken when modelling SN rates. One is to measure volumetric SN rates as a function of redshift and fit an assumed DTD. This approach seems to suggest a DTD of the form DTD ~$\\tau^{-1}$ perhaps with a transition to becoming constant at early times.https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.7978.pdf This may be explained by a progenitor model with two distinct progenitors. These two progenitors are often referred to as a prompt component, with short delay times, and a delayed component, with longer delays between star formation and SN explosion. Another approach is to observe SN rates for individual galaxies as a function of star formation rate of the host galaxy, averaged over all observed galaxies. This approach does not formally define or assume a DTD, and instead assumes that the SN rate depends on physical parameters such as stellar mass and star formation rate of the host galaxy. The consensus model for this approach is the A+B model. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.00793.pdf\n"

    "Not only SN Ia but also CMB observations strongly indicate the presence of dark energy.The CMB is a snap shot of the Universe before the cosmic structure developed and has temperature anisotropies which are influenced by dark energy.  This snap shot tells us the cosmic history from the photon decoupling epoch to the present.The angular power spectrum of CMB temperature anisotropies measured by Wilkinson Microwave  Anisotropy  Probe  (WMAP) implies  that  it  is  dominated  by acoustic peaks arising from gravity-driven sound waves in the photon-baryon fluid.  And then  the  positions  of  these  acoustic  peaks  are  shifted  by  cosmic  expansion.   Thus  the positions and amplitudes of acoustic peaks contain important cosmic information.\n",
    "Baryons were strongly coupled to photons before the decoupling epoch.  After recombination ($z_r \\approx 1100$) baryons  got  free  from  Compton  drag  of  photons  and  stayed  at  a fixed radius, i.e., sound horizon.  It determines the first acoustic peak in CMB anisotropy that we can observe directly. Since the size of the sound horizon is predicted from theory, $l_s \\sim H^{-1}(z_r)$, this sound horizon serves as a standard ruler by measuring the angular scale of the first acoustic peak.  It is analogous to how SN Ia can be used as a standard candle but is completely independent from the SN Ia technique.\n",

    "Galaxy clusters also leave an imprint on the CMB, the so-called Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (SZ) effect The SZ effect stands for the distortion of the CMB spectrum through inverse Compton scatterings due to the collisions of the CMB photons and the high energy electrons  in  galaxy  clusters.   Measuring  this  distortion  of  the  CMB,  we  can  estimate masses of the clusters.  Since the SZ effect is a scattering effect, its magnitude is redshift-independent; very distant clusters are as easy to detect as nearby clusters. When combined with accurate redshifts and mass estimates for the clusters, e.g.  X-ray observation, the SZ effect plays a role of a standard ruler and can be used as a distance indicator.  This is the same method as comparing the absolute magnitude with the apparent one.  The SZ effect may also provide interesting constraints on the dark energy. The combination of CMB and SN Ia observations indicates that our Universe is spatially flat and the matter component is about one quarter of the critical density, $\\Omega_m \\approx 0.3 $ This implies the need for dark energy as a missing component $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}=1-\\Omega_m \\approx 0.7$ which\n",

    "Studying BAO is also a significant investigation for dark energy. As mentioned above, after decoupling baryons stay at the distance of the sound horizon whereas dark matter stays at the center of overdensity.  They attract matter and eventually form galaxies.  Therefore it is expected that a number of galaxies are separated by the sound horizon.  We call it BAO signal.  It means that by observing the large scale structure (LSS) of galaxies, we\n",
    "can measure the sound horizon scales and compare them with theoretical predictions.\n",
    "To analyze the BAO signal,  we do not need to resolve galaxy magnitudes or galaxy images.  The only thing to be determined is their 3-dimensional position.  Thus in that sense, BAO observations are safer from astronomical uncertainties than other dark energy probes.\n",

    "The sound waves that propagated in the pre-recombination universe produced a pronounced peak in the two-point correlation function of the cosmological-density field.This “baryon-acoustic oscillation” (BAO) peak,is centered on a comoving distance equal to the sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$.Observed at a redshift z, the BAO peak position in the transverse (angular) direction determines the ratio $D_M(z)/ r_d$ ,where $D_M(z)=(1 + z)D_A(z)$ is the “comoving” angular-diameter distance ($D_A$ is the “traditional” angular-diameter distance). In the radial (redshift) direction, the peak position determines $D_H(z)/ r_d$, where $D_H(z)=c/H(z)$ is the Hubble distance.Since $D_M$, $D_H$ and $r_d$ all have simple dependencies on the cosmological parameters, observation of the BAO feature constrains those parameters, especially when combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. In particular, one can constrain models beyond the flat-ΛCDM model that describes CMB data, deriving constraints on cosmological curvature and the dark-energy equation of state. Furthermore, the shape of the spectrum of CMB anisotropies can be used to calculate the value of $r_d$ to percent-level precision $r_d$ ~147 Mpc and the use of this value allows one to derive $D_M(z)$ and $D_H(z)$ from BAO measurements.These absolute distances can be combined with relative distances determined with type Ia supernovae to extrapolate to z=0, yielding a “top-down” measurement of $H_0$.\n",
